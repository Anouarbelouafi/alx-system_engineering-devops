## Tasks

### 0. Use a private key

> Write a Bash script that uses `ssh` to connect to your server using the private key `~/.ssh/holberton` with the user `ubuntu.`
>**Repo:**
>
>- GitHub repository:  `alx-system_engineering-devops`
>- Directory:  `0x0B-ssh`
>- File:  `0-use_a_private_key`

### 1. Create an SSH key pair

> Write a Bash script that creates an RSA key pair.
> **Repo:**
>
> - GitHub repository:  `alx-system_engineering-devops`
> - Directory:  `0x0B-ssh`
> - File:  `1-create_ssh_key_pair`

### 2. Client configuration file

> Your Ubuntu Vagrant machine has an SSH configuration file for the local SSH client, let’s configure it to our needs so that you can connect to a server without typing a password. Share your SSH client configuration in your answer file.
>**Repo:**
>
>- GitHub repository:  `alx-system_engineering-devops`
>- Directory:  `0x0B-ssh`
>- File: `2-ssh_config`

### 3. Let me in

> Now that you have successfully connected to your server, we would also like to join the party.
>**Repo:**
>
>- GitHub repository:  `alx-system_engineering-devops`
>- Directory:  `0x0B-ssh`

### 4. Client configuration file (w/ Puppet)

> Let’s practice using Puppet to make changes to our configuration file. Just as in the previous configuration file task, we’d like you to set up your client SSH configuration file so that you can connect to a server without typing a password.
>**Repo:**
>
>- GitHub repository:  `alx-system_engineering-devops`
>- Directory:  `0x0B-ssh`
>- File: `4-puppet_ssh_config.pp`
