# The issues with the given infrastructure are

* SPOF (Single Point of Failure): The infrastructure has no redundancy that can help in avoiding SPOFs. Any single failure in any part of the system will cause the entire system to stop working.
* Security issues: The infrastructure has no firewall or HTTPS, which can make it vulnerable to cyber attacks.
* No monitoring: The infrastructure has no monitoring system, which can make it difficult to detect and respond to issues.
